                <li>Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator for best results).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Cook the Rice:

                <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.</li>

            <li>Drain and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>   
        <li>
            Fry the Onions:
            <ul>
                <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Remove half for garnishing later.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the Meat:
            <ul>
                <li>Add the marinated meat to the pot with the remaining onions.</li>
                <li>Cook until the meat is browned and cooked through. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, cilantro, and mint leaves.</li>
                <li>Cook for a few more minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li> 
        <li>
            Layer the Biryani:
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low.</li>
                <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>       
        <li>
            Dum Cooking:
            <ul>
                <li>Cook on low heat for about 25-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
                <li>You can place a heavy pan or tava (griddle) under the pot to prevent direct heat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve:
            <ul>
